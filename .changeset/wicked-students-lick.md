"ilicon": major

- First working version, still plenty that could be improved on but for the most part seems to be working. Tested locally prior to this, hopefully works as expected.

So far:

- Grab all links on page
- Pop in a small favicon of the link's href
- Uses duckduckgo's favicon api
- Plenty of config
- First real package
